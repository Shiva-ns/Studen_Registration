Overview of the system

The Student Record System is a program that helps you keep track of students. You can add new students by entering their name, email, course, and phone number. It also lets you view a list of all the students and search for a specific student by their ID. If you need to remove a student from the record, you can easily delete them by entering their ID. The system allows you to save all the student records to a file for future use. It's an easy-to-use tool for managing student information effectively.
